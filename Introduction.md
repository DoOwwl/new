So I am new to coding and for now I am only learning Python but eventually my plans will EXPAND :D.I am currently just posting for
the fun of it and while I advance I just hope to edit and add more content/logic to my codes. I will be browsing to see other
projects and hope to give my own twist with it one day.
#Thank You
